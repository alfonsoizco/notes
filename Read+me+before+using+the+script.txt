1. Scripts are provided to help you in practicing my demos, so please watch the lecture before using this script
2. I used these scripts for preparing demos, to use this you have to change few variables in this script with your data 
3. Please change below values in these script, based on your setup. (I have explained each of this in my lectures)
	
    a) IP address in connection URI 
       For sure this will change for you

    b) Exchange name 
       You have to publish to exchange, which has appropriate binding to queue from which you want to consume                messages

    c) Queue Name
       Both publisher and consumer should have same queue name

    d) Routing Key
       Routing key will differ based on the binding key between the exchange and the queue to which you want to 
       route the message. Message will be routed to a queue which has a binding key same as the routing key you used         in publisher

Apart from above values, you should also change other parameters, if i mention anything in my lecture.
